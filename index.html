            Oh Angela... where do I even begin? You've been my pookie wookie
            chookie dookie bookie bababooey bear for as long as I can remember (to
            be exact /js/) I love you so much and there's no better thing than
            getting to spend time with you. I hope and pray to our lord and savior
            (Donald Trump) that we have a long and happy life with our ninitos and
            our tiny animal companions. The future can be kinda scary sometimes
            because we don't know what'll happen but I know that everything will
            be okay as long as you are by my side. You are my wife and my
            girlfriend and my bestfriend, and last but not least, my silly wittle
            girl who has the cutest dance moves, the most adorable smile I've ever
            seen, and the best fits in the whole world🙈
